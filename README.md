How do I approach designing software?
  When designing software I first make myself an outline of the project to have a better understanding of the requirements and how I could best go about fulfilling them. This project has helped me to understand the importance of creating an outline beforehand and can greatly 
  simplify things by doing so.

How do I approach developing programs?
  The first thing I do when developing programs is to break it down into its individual pieces. This helps me to complete the program part by part when I am able to test each piece and how it meshes with all of the other parts as I go.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
  The same methods that I use when approaching creating a new program or designing new software can be used outside of computer science as a great way to reach your goals. Taking a task and dividing it into smaller tasks can help make it feel more managable and help to see 
  just how much of the task you have completed.
